  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>T cells discriminate between self and foreign antigenic peptides, displayed on antigen presenting cell surfaces, via the TCR. While the molecular interactions between TCR and its ligands are well characterized in vitro, quantitative measurements of these interactions in living cells are required to accurately resolve the physical mechanisms of TCR signaling. We report direct single molecule measurements of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in hybrid junctions between live primary T cells and supported lipid membranes. Every pMHC:TCR complex over the entire cell is tracked while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of ZAP70, as a readout of TCR triggering. Mean dwell times for pMHC:TCR molecular binding of 5 and 54 s were measured for two different pMHC:TCR systems. Single molecule measurements of the pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex indicate that TCR triggering is stoichiometric with agonist pMHC in a 1:1 ratio. Thus any signal amplification must occur downstream of TCR triggering.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An essential aspect of adaptive immunity is the ability of T cells to discriminate between structurally similar agonist and non-stimulatory self peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (<span class="citation" data-ref-id="WL94">Weiss and Littman, 1994</span>). Fewer than 10 agonist pMHC molecules can trigger T cells (<span class="citation" data-ref-id="Irv+02">Irvine et al., 2002</span>; <span class="citation" data-ref-id="Man+11">Manz et al., 2011</span>), and the signaling response occurs on a timescale of seconds (<span class="citation" data-ref-id="Hus+07">Huse et al., 2007</span>). It has been recognized for decades that subtle, peptide-specific differences in binding parameters, especially kinetic rates for the pMHC and T cell receptor (TCR) reaction, seem to be the basis of antigen recognition (<span class="citation" data-ref-id="Mat+94">Matsui et al., 1994</span>; <span class="citation" data-ref-id="Tia+07">Tian et al., 2007</span>). Experimental correlations between molecular pMHC:TCR binding kinetics, typically determined from solution assays of soluble extracellular domains and bulk measurements of T cell activity, have provided the foundation for much of this understanding.</p>
